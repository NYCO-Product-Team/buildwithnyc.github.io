      <p class="lead">The Service Design Studio is seeking emerging community conscious leaders who are interested in service design, public administration, social services, and/or community organizing for a 3-month fellowship.  The Service Design Studio sits within the the Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity, and helps further the City’s use of community-centered design and research methods. We partner with City agencies to engage with residents and those who deliver services so that their voices and insights can shape new and existing programs. </p> 

      <p class = "lead">Fellows will support our projects in a variety of ways including landscape research to better understand an issue area, supporting design research (co-facilitating workshops, interviews, focus groups, etc), and leading in making materials such as informational one pagers, writing reflective blog posts, and creating worksheets to drive collaboration within our projects.</p>
